#   Workflow Unit to read in data for the ML workflow.              #
#                                                                   #
#   Also showcased here is the concept of branching based on        #
#   whether the workflow is in "train" or "predict" mode.           #
#                                                                   #
#   If the workflow is in "training" mode, it will read in the data #
#   before converting it to a Numpy array and save it for use       #
#   later. During training, we already have values for the output,  #
#   and this gets saved to "target."                                #
#                                                                   #
#   Finally, whether the workflow is in training or predict mode,   #
#   it will always read in a set of descriptors from a datafile     #
#   defined in settings.py                                          #
